This Chrome extension puts a resize button inside the Freshbooks Timer so you can quickly resize the window and continue working with it in the corner of your screen.

TO INSTALL: Download this (if it's zipped, unzip it) to a convenient location. Then in Chrome go to chrome://extensions/ and click Load Unpacked Extension. Choose the folder that contains these files.
